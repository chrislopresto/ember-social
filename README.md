# ember-social

ember-social is a fledgling Ember component library for social sharing widgets. Think Tweet buttons, Facebook like buttons, LinkedIn share buttons, etc.

We welcome contributions. Adding share buttons can be tedious. Let's make it easy for everyone.

To install this addon in your ember-cli project, use `npm install ember-social`.

Run the dummy app for examples and documentation.

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.
